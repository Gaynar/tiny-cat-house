# Hector's Adventure - Build Plan

This plan replaces the old Kitty Tower Idle build plan. New implementation should follow [hector-roguelike-gdd.md](hector-roguelike-gdd.md). The previous [kitty-tower-idle-gdd-v4.md](kitty-tower-idle-gdd-v4.md) is historical reference only.

The current repository already contains a React + Vite app with many tower-idle systems. Treat those systems as legacy unless a step explicitly keeps them.

## How To Use This Plan

- Each step is an executable unit.
- Read the listed GDD sections before implementing the step.
- Keep changes scoped to the step. Do not rebuild future systems early.
- Keep user-facing systems simple until the full day/night loop is playable.
- Preserve useful project infrastructure: React + Vite, JavaScript, Vitest, localStorage, Lucide React, and `.pixel-art`.
- Use the new save key `hectorsAdventure_save`.
- Do not reuse `kittyTowerIdle_save`.

---

# Phase 1 - Pivot Foundation

Goal: retire the visible Kitty Tower Idle identity and establish Hector's Adventure data, state, and navigation skeleton.

## Step 1 - Rename App Identity And Save Contract

**Goal:** The app boots as Hector's Adventure and uses a clean save schema.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 1, 3, 15, 17.

**Do:**

1. Replace visible "Kitty Tower Idle" branding with "Hector's Adventure".
2. Change the app save key to `hectorsAdventure_save`.
3. Create a new initial state shape:
   - `version`
   - `day`
   - `phase: 'day' | 'night'`
   - `resources: { fishbones, cannedTuna }`
   - `house`
   - `hector`
   - `currentRun: null | object`
   - `settings`
4. Remove save assumptions tied to Coins, Comfort, Miso, Bean, Mochi, relationships, cat roster assignment, room production formulas, and offline progress.
5. Keep load fallback behavior: corrupt or missing saves should create a fresh Hector save.
6. Add a visible reset-save debug button while the game is in development.

**Acceptance:**

- App loads without depending on legacy cat data.
- localStorage uses `hectorsAdventure_save`.
- Reset save clears only the new save key.
- Refreshing preserves Hector resources and day count.

## Step 2 - Static Game Data

**Goal:** Core Hector data exists as plain JS modules.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.

**Do:**

Create data files under `src/data/`:

1. `resources.js` - Fishbones and Canned Tuna metadata.
2. `houseRooms.js` - Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom, Storage/Washing Room, Attic.
3. `roomUpgrades.js` - first upgrade tier for each room.
4. `hector.js` - starting stats and Fighter class reference.
5. `abilities.js` - 10 Fighter ability definitions.
6. `enemies.js` - Alley Rat, Bold Pigeon, Tiny Dog, Rival Tabby, Bin Baron.
7. `statuses.js` - Wet, Hungry, Spooked.
8. `nodes.js` - Combat, Event, Rest, Shop, Elite, Boss.
9. `events.js` - 4 to 6 simple Back Alley events.

**Acceptance:**

- All data files import cleanly.
- Miso, Bean, and Mochi are no longer required by the app.
- Bin Baron is represented as a boss using 3x HP and 1.5x damage against a base enemy profile.

## Step 3 - App Shell And Phase Navigation

**Goal:** The player can see the current phase and switch through the intended MVP flow.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 4, 6, 7, 8.

**Do:**

1. Build a simple app shell with:
   - top resource bar
   - day/night phase indicator
   - main content area
   - debug reset button
2. Add phase actions:
   - day phase can start or advance the day timer
   - completed day can start a night run
   - night run can return home
3. Keep the UI functional, not decorative.

**Acceptance:**

- The player can move from Day to Night and back.
- The day count increments when a new day begins.
- Resources are shown as Fishbones and Canned Tuna.

---

# Phase 2 - Day Phase

Goal: the house becomes a useful preparation layer for night runs.

## Step 4 - Fixed Cutaway House

**Goal:** Show the terraced house with five fixed rooms.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 6.2, 6.3.

**Do:**

1. Replace tower room rendering with a fixed dollhouse layout:
   - Floor 3: Attic
   - Floor 2: Bedroom and Storage/Washing Room
   - Floor 1: Living Room and Kitchen
2. Each room shows:
   - room name
   - activity label
   - upgrade tier
   - current effect
3. Show Hector activity placeholders in unlocked rooms.
4. Keep `.pixel-art` support for future art.

**Acceptance:**

- All five rooms are visible.
- No room requires cat drag/drop assignment.
- The house reads as a side-cutaway structure.

## Step 5 - 30-Second Day Timer

**Goal:** Day phase progresses while the app is open and produces preparation resources.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 5, 6.1, 6.3.

**Do:**

1. Add a 30-second day timer.
2. While the timer runs, rooms produce simple MVP resources:
   - Kitchen can produce Canned Tuna.
   - Other rooms can produce small Fishbones or preparation effects.
3. No offline progress.
4. At the end of the timer, mark the day as ready for night.

**Acceptance:**

- Timer advances only while the app is open.
- At day end, the player can start the night.
- Refreshing preserves timer state well enough for development.

## Step 6 - Room Upgrades

**Goal:** The player can spend Fishbones on permanent room upgrades that affect future runs.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 5, 6.4.

**Do:**

1. Add room upgrade actions.
2. Implement first-tier effects:
   - Living Room: +1 Attack

   - `completedNodeIds`
   - `status`
2. Generate a visible Back Alley map with around 8 nodes before a Boss node.
3. Include Combat, Event, Rest, Elite, and Boss nodes.
4. Keep Shop disabled or placeholder until later.

## Step 8 - Map UI And Node Selection

**Goal:** The player can move through the night map.

**Inputs:** GDD Sections 8.1, 8.2.

**Do:**

1. Render the map as a branching or lane-based node view.
